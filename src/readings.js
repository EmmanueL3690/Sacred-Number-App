      "This reading suggests you are facing a turbulent situation. Victory is possible through courage and determination, but the risks are high. If you lack the strength to push through, retreat is safer. It is a bad time for peace, negotiation, or patience-testing situations—but a strong time for battle, sports, arguments, or competitive work.",

      "The road ahead will be difficult, with many conflicts and challenges. Trying to keep peace will not work now. Only courage, strength, and a strong will can lead to success. If I feel weak or unsure, it is wiser to step back and wait."
